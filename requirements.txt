Technical Requirements-
1. Node.js & Express.js: The application will be a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle routing and middleware.
2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.


Timeline-
Hour 0: Planning-
Gather content and design ideas, create wireframes and mockups. Plan out how the application will work, which routes might be necessary and which pages need to be made.


Hour 1:  Setup-
Set up the project repository, initialize the Node.js application, and install necessary dependencies (Express.js, EJS).
Create the application structure, including routes, views, and static files.
Set up the Express.js server and define the necessary routes.


Hour 2-3: Implementing Features-
Implement the post creation feature. This includes creating the form on the home page and handling the form submission in the server.
Implement the post viewing feature. This includes displaying all the posts on the home page.
Implement the post edit feature. This includes using a form to load the existing blog post and allowing the user to edit and save the post.
Implement the delete feature. This allows the user to click a button and remove the post from the home page.
Implement the alternative list to show a different set of todo tasks.
Test the application to ensure that post creation and viewing are working correctly.


Hour 4-5: Styling and Polishing-
Style the application. This includes creating a CSS file, linking it to your EJS templates, and writing CSS or using Bootstrap/Flexbox/Grid to style the application.
Test the application on different devices and browsers to ensure the styling works correctly.
Fix any bugs or issues that came up during testing.
